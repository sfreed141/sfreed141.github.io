I love to program and solve problems. My areas of interest are Computer Graphics and Embedded Systems. I plan on pursuing a master's degree in computer science after I complete my undergraduate work.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nUnfortunately, all of my class projects must be private in order to prevent other students from plagiarizing. Most other personal projects are me playing around with something that doesn't warrant creating a new repository. However, I'm considering porting the raytracing project I'm currently working on in CPE 473: Advanced Rendering to Rust, a language I've dabbled with a bit but would like to actually make something substantial with. Anyways, here is a list of projects I've worked on:\r\n\r\n* Implemented a simple microcontroller on a Nexys 3 FPGA using VHDL. The microcontroller was then programmed using assembly to create a simple 1-player pong game. This game also utilized a VGA module for display output and a UART module for serial communication (both modules were also implemented on the FPGA using VHDL).\r\n* Implemented data structures and algorithms such as stacks, queues, heaps, binary search trees, AVL trees, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.\r\n* Decompressor in C using the LZW algorithm.\r\n* Linear simulator in C.\r\n* Automated building and testing system in C.\r\n* MIPS Assembler and Simulator (written in Java).\r\n* Created a scene using C++ and OpenGL. The program used deferred shading, bloom, and SSAO. See [here](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~zwood/teaching/csc471/finalW16_3/stfreed/index.html) for a complete write-up of the project.\r\n* A report on using numerical integration techniques to create a parameterization of a curve which moves at constant speed over time. View the report [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fywgrqsktwzv).\r\n\r\nCurrent projects (Spring Quarter 2016):\r\n\r\n* Advanced raytracer (goal is to support advanced lighting such as global lighting, reflection, refraction, and shadows. If time permits, volumetric lighting will be added).\r\n* Exploring the TI MSP430G2553 microcontroller. Final project will involve interfacing the microcontroller with various sensors and displays to create a useful, real-world product.\r\n\r\n### Course Overview\r\nSoftware: Data Structures & Algorithms, Systems Programming, Computer Architecture, Computer Graphics, Advanced Rendering\r\n\r\nHardware: Circuit Analysis, Digital & Computer Design, Digital Electronics, Embedded Systems\r\n\r\nMath: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Numerical Optimization\r\n\r\n### Resume\r\nA version of my resume is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKrZVp89BuflP0Quqkug5riMBp2vRjINZmHbATHvE3o/edit?usp=sharing), with personal information removed.
