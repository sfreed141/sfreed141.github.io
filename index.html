<p>I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate student at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Math. I love to program and solve problems. My areas of interest are Computer Graphics and Embedded Systems. I plan on pursuing a master's degree in computer science after I complete my undergraduate work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all of my class projects must be private in order to prevent other students from plagiarizing. Most other personal projects are me playing around with something that doesn't warrant creating a new repository. However, I'm considering porting the raytracing project I'm currently working on in CPE 473: Advanced Rendering to Rust, a language I've dabbled with a bit but would like to actually make something substantial with. Anyways, here is a list of projects I've worked on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented a simple microcontroller on a Nexys 3 FPGA using VHDL. The microcontroller was then programmed using assembly to create a simple 1-player pong game. This game also utilized a VGA module for display output and a UART module for serial communication (both modules were also implemented on the FPGA using VHDL).</li>
<li>Implemented data structures and algorithms such as stacks, queues, heaps, binary search trees, AVL trees, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.</li>
<li>Decompressor in C using the LZW algorithm.</li>
<li>Linear simulator in C.</li>
<li>Automated building and testing system in C.</li>
<li>MIPS Assembler and Simulator (written in Java).</li>
<li>Created a scene using C++ and OpenGL. The program used deferred shading, bloom, and SSAO. See <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Ezwood/teaching/csc471/finalW16_3/stfreed/index.html">here</a> for a complete write-up of the project.</li>
<li>A report on using numerical integration techniques to create a parameterization of a curve which moves at constant speed over time. View the report <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/fywgrqsktwzv">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Current projects (Spring Quarter 2016):</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced raytracer (goal is to support advanced lighting such as global lighting, reflection, refraction, and shadows. If time permits, volumetric lighting will be added).</li>
<li>Exploring the TI MSP430G2553 microcontroller. Final project will involve interfacing the microcontroller with various sensors and displays to create a useful, real-world product.</li>
</ul>
